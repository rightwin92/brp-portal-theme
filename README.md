# BRP Portal Theme (WordPress Theme)

A **lightweight, full-width app** theme designed for the Biz Referrals Portal plugin:
- **Tabs + cards + filters** layout
- Works out-of-the-box with `[brp_portal]`, `[brp_submit]`, `[brp_dashboard]`
- Classic theme (`style.css` header + `index.php`) — installs cleanly
